This is a simple Flask application that serves as a template for a new Flask project. The application is structured following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, where:

The models directory contains the data models used by the application.
The views directory contains the user interface views that are rendered to the user.
The controllers directory contains the application logic that handles user requests and updates the models and views accordingly.
The application uses the following libraries:

Flask: A micro web framework for building web applications.
Jinja2: A template engine for Python that allows you to generate HTML, XML, or other markup formats.
SQLAlchemy: A SQL toolkit and ORM that provides a set of high-level API for connecting to and manipulating databases.
